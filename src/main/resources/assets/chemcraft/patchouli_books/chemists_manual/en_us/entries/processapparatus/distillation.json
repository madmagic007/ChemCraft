This entry assumes you have a understanding of the concept of distillation and functionality of a continuous distillation tower."

      "text": "The distillation tower is a multiblock structure 3x7x3 in size will cover most fluids. Wider allows for more flow, larger differences in boiling points might need a taller tower. Each layer should be made out of insulated blocks, the bottom and top layers must be solid, every layer in between must have the center be the 'sieve plate' block (for a 5x5 column this would be 3x3). The second to top layer must be hollow. One block on the bottom must be the distillery block."

      "text": "Right click with the wrench to validate the structure. Feed the fluid mixture into the side of the column, the height it is inserted at is determined by the composition. The top and bottom layers are for cooling/heating, and product to be distilled is not meant to be inserted here. If there is a larger share of highest boiler, it should be inserted closer to the bottom and vice versa. For more optimal and efficient distillation, aim for the feed temperature to roughly match the proportional combined boiling point of the mixture."
