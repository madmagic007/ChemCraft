      "text": "The furnace heater is a very efficient heater, but burnable fuel is required. There is no heating setpoint configurable, the heating is dependant on the rate of flow. At 50000 l/h, this is 100Â°C. Lower flowrates will heat up more.$(br2)The furnace heater has a cold (input) and hot (output) side, it is important that fluids respect this flow path."
